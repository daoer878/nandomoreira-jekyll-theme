**Ylläs Aurora and Twilight**
10pm-6am streets' lights will be turned off for our NORTHEN LIGHTS :milky_way:
[Brochure](https://issuu.com/visityllas/docs/yllas_esite_2016-2017_100_en)
The street lights will be turned off in Ylläs every evening at 10 p.m. starting 3rd of November 2016 until the mid February 2017. This will make it easier for you to see the Northern Lights. The Northern Lights can be seen in the northern part of the sky late in the evening, when the sky is clear. Along with Northern Lights, the stars, moon and snow illuminate the nights.

Turning lights off will also help to reduce our Carbon Footprint in Pallas-Yllästunturi National Park.

When going out at night to explore the stars and Northern Lights, please walk on the pedestrianized paths. If possible use a reflector or a headlamp so that you are visible to the motorists. Remember to turn off the headlight when watching the northern lights. It takes some time before your eyes get used to the darkness and see the colours. Try also to photograph the Northern Lights, on photos the colours become brighter when you use a longer exposure.

In Ylläs You can find various Northern Light activities, like snowshoeing, reindeer sledging, ice swimming from the village Sauna or floating with dry suites under the Northern.

**Ylläs Aurora Application**

The Ylläs Aurora app tells you where the northern lights have been seen! All users of the app get a notification, when a user reports seeing northern lights in Ylläs. The Ylläs Aurora app is available on for iPhone, Android and Windows-phones with price of 2,99€.

We wish you a memorable holiday in Ylläs!
